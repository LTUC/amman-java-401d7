# Prework: IntelliJ IDEA

**IntelliJ IDEA** is a powerful editor with many features. It's built to help create a wide variety of Java applications. This short prework leads us through a tutorial that will show us how to create and run simple Java programs.

## Your First Java App

Navigate to [Creating and Running Your First Java Application](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html){:target="_blank"} guide and follow the instructions there, up until the part about packaging.

The guide shows you how to create and run simple Java applications. It shows you how to start using its powerful template and auto-complete system as well.

Only complete these sections:

* Creating a project
* Exploring the project structure
* Creating a package and a class
* Writing code for the HelloWorld class
  * Using a live template for the main() method
  * Using code auto-completion
  * Using a live template for println()
* Building and running the application

**DO NOT** continue through the sections dedicated to packaging and running a packaged Java app, as we'll be using other tools for that in the course.

## Debugging Java

IntelliJ IDEA comes with a powerful debugger tool. Debugging programs is an essential skill for programmers. Take time to familiarize yourself with the built-in debugging tool.

* [Debugging Your First Java Application](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-your-first-java-application.html){:target="_blank"}

Follow through all the directions in every section of this page.

* Before you start...
* Putting breakpoints
* Starting a debugger session
* Stepping through the application
  * Stepping through the statements directly
  * Stepping through the method calls

## Submitting Your Work

Capture screenshots of your code and its output. Consolidate them into a folder and submit it into the Canvas assignment designated for the Java Tutorial prework.

Capture screenshots of you debugging your code. Write something offering your own definitions and explanations for each of these debugging concepts:

* Breakpoint
* Step-to-next-line
* Step-inside-function-call
* Step-out-of-function-call
